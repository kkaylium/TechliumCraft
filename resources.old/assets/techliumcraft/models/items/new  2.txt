4:26   MrComputerGhost: I know
4:26   MrComputerGhost: Hai
4:26   Candicejoy87: although i AM sexy too ;D
4:28   Candicejoy87: i most certainly do not disagree with the sentiment that kayla is also sexy as all hell, as noted on occasions too numerous to count 
4:28   MrComputerGhost: Would you actually use "too" in that context instead of to
4:28   MrComputerGhost: It makes sense
4:29   MrComputerGhost: But it just looks weird
4:29   Candicejoy87: too numerous to count XD
4:29   Candicejoy87: it's grammatically incorrect to do it another way xP
4:29   MrComputerGhost: too numerour to
4:30   MrComputerGhost: It just looks wierd
4:30   Candicejoy87: you find the what what?
4:30   Candicejoy87: well theyre useless with dremora lords and storm atronachs
4:30   MrComputerGhost: I hate the English language
4:30   Candicejoy87: except for plot elements of course
4:30   Candicejoy87: i dont disagree comp 
4:31   MrComputerGhost: זמן עברית
4:32   MrComputerGhost: Yay for Multi-Language keyboards!
4:32   Candicejoy87: wakarimasen
4:32   Candicejoy87: i would have typed it out but i dont have the japanese language pack installed yet xP
4:33   MrComputerGhost: I have a Hebrew language pack installed, only because of the fact that I've actually needed to use it
4:33   Candicejoy87: so does anyone know who the hot chick in the corner is?
4:33   MrComputerGhost: The bottom right corner?
4:33   MrComputerGhost: I have no idea
4:34   MrComputerGhost: She looks like my girlfriend though
4:34   Candicejoy87: really? she looks a lot like my bff. striking resemblence. quite striking, though, isn't she?
4:34   MrComputerGhost: Indeed
4:35   MrComputerGhost: Inconceivable!
4:35   Candicejoy87: *hi5's comp for conspiring to hit on the kayla* XD
4:35   Candicejoy87: annoying little piece of what kayla?
4:36   MrComputerGhost: You do realize it muffles you when you put your hands in front of your face?
4:37   Candicejoy87: it muffles sound to put things in the way of the sound waves? how? that makes no sense! XD
4:37   MrComputerGhost: I don't know
4:37   MrComputerGhost: I just know that the phone I'm watching this on is getting really hot
4:38   MrComputerGhost: But nowhere near as hot as Kayla
4:38   Candicejoy87: well to be fair, any device with kayla's picture tends to get really hot. seems she's so damn hot she overheats ALL the things!
4:38   MrComputerGhost: ^^
4:40   Candicejoy87: it's ok, your cute voice will compensate!
4:41   MrComputerGhost: Her giggle also compensates
4:41   Candicejoy87: and her squeals.
4:41   Candicejoy87: super cute 
4:41   MrComputerGhost: Indeed
4:42   MrComputerGhost: And her hair
4:42   MrComputerGhost: And her eyes
4:42   Candicejoy87: hey i was about to say eyes 
4:42   Candicejoy87: XD
4:42   MrComputerGhost: and every little part about her OMG KAYLA YOU'RE SO *** HOT
4:42   Candicejoy87: and her lips~
4:42   Candicejoy87: OH THOSE LIPS~ 
4:44   Candicejoy87: kayla is sexier than any model i've ever seen
4:44   MrComputerGhost: Plot Twist: Kayla is a model
4:44   Candicejoy87: she should be
4:45   Candicejoy87: she's got the body
4:45   MrComputerGhost: ^^^^^^
4:45   Candicejoy87: but not the personality. she can't be mean and catty like them
4:45   MrComputerGhost: True
4:46   MrComputerGhost: She's sexier than most of them combined
4:46   Candicejoy87: mmmm, but that personality. it beats everything tenfold.
4:46   MrComputerGhost: No
4:47   MrComputerGhost: Integer.MAX_VALUEfold
4:47   Candicejoy87: BigInteger's max value fold
4:47   MrComputerGhost: BIgInteger doesn't have a max value does it?
4:47   Candicejoy87: precisely 
4:48   MrComputerGhost: I see
4:48   Candicejoy87: (technically it's limited to your RAM + VRAM, but well)
4:49   MrComputerGhost: So are you saying the awesomeness of her personality is undefined?
4:49   Candicejoy87: infinitely infinite i'd say. aleph sub infinity.
4:50   MrComputerGhost: True dat
4:50   Candicejoy87: my personal favorite highlights are her ridiculous levels of intelligence and kindness 
4:51   MrComputerGhost: True
4:51   MrComputerGhost: I also like her adorableness
4:51   Candicejoy87: mm yes quite, though that's partially a function her voice (which is also quite amazing) as well as her personality
4:52   Candicejoy87: very endearing indeed.
4:52   Candicejoy87: i do wonder if she realizes we've been completely serious this whole time.
